Decipher Quest 
============== 
The whole game was created in 48 hours for LudumDare 32 (2015.04.19-20).

This is a pigpen cipher game. The game offers puzzels based on basic Freemasonry ciphers. 

I used a flat design philosophy, based on this colors http://flatuicolors.com/ . 

Story 
===== 
You are the roboter Fred. You live with your roboter family on a nice little planet. One day a Space Blob appears. He has a cryptic language and wants to destroy your world. 
Your only chance (weapon) is to decipher his language to talk and convince him to not destory your planet. 

How to play 
=========== 
Drag and Drop the highlighted card-letters onto the darker ones. The Space Blobs language uses a simple geometric substitution cipher. You have to find equivalent characters or symbols to form useful words. 

When you think you are ready, press Fred to read or send a decoded message. 

BEWARE: If you cipher or decipher wrong, Fred and your planet gets damaged from the Space Blobs laserbeam! Fred has only 10 chances! 

Tip 1: 
Memorize the ciphers when letter to pigpen. 

Tip 2: 
The latin alphabet has an order. The pigpen ciphers have the same order. 

Tip 3 (use only if you can't beat it):
